# Classification Models for Activity Recognition using Smart Phone Accelerometers 
## (Master Thesis - Umeå University)

The huge amount of data generated by accelerometers in smartphones creates new opportunities for useful data mining applications. Machine Learning algorithms can be effectively used for
tasks such as the classification and clustering of physical activity patterns. This paper builds and evaluates a system that uses real-world smartphone-based tri-axial accelerometers labeled data to
perform activity recognition tasks. Over a million data recorded at the frequency 20Hz, was filtered and pre-processed to extract relevant features for the classification task. The features were
selected to obtain higher classification accuracy. These supervised classification models, namely, random forest, support vector machines, decision tree, na¨ıve Bayes classifier, and multinomial
logistic regression are evaluated and finally compared with a few unsupervised classification models such as k-means and self-organizing map (SOM) technique built on an unlabelled dataset.
Statistical model evaluation metrics such as accuracy-precision-recall are used to compare the classification performances of the models. It was interesting to see that all supervised learning
methods achieved very high accuracy(over 95%) on labeled datasets as against 65% by unsupervised SOM. Moreover, they registered very low similarity (23%) among themselves on unlabelled
datasets with the same selected features.

## Data and Tools
Since the data set is huge, this project used 500 randomly sampled labelled data from each label for testing and training purposes. This was to ensure that the model was trained to recognize each label irrespective of its imbalance in the original data set. Overall, 3,000 labeled sampled data set was used for further processing. Furthermore, the random sample (500 data) was extracted from the unlabeled dataset for prediction and comparison between supervised and unsupervised classifiers
